      I am currently a professional research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder
      in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC). I work with Alireza Doostan
      and Stephen Becker on data compression techniques for large-scale scientific simulations.
      I also work independently with Stephen Becker on non-convex Newton-type optimization methods.
      I recieved my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2020 and 2022 respectively from CU.

      Broadly, my research interests are in computational and mathematical science.
      I have worked in areas such as non-convex optimization, deep learning, data
      compression, and algorithmic economics. I appreciate both the theory and application
      side of problems, which is to say I enjoy both proving a theorem and programming a
      software package.
