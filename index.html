      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2024, I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I am advised by Alexsandr Aravkin.
        I am also a 2025 recipient of the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF).
        Prior to this I...
        <ul>
          <li>Worked as a professional research assistant in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC) at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2022-2024,
            where I collaborated with Alireza Doostan and Stephen Becker on data compression techniques for large-scale scientific simulations.
          </li>
          <li>Earned my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020 and 2022 respectively,
            where I was advised by Stephen Becker for my masters thesis on non-convex Newton-type optimization methods.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of research, I try to get outside as much as possible through climbing, skiing, hiking, rafting, 
        football (the other kind), and a variety of other hobbies.
