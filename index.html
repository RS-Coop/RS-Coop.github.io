      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
        Previously, I worked as a professional research assistant in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC)
        at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2022-2024. There, I worked with Alireza Doostan and Stephen Becker
        on data compression techniques for large-scale scientific simulations. I also work independently with Stephen Becker 
        on non-convex Newton-type optimization methods. I earned my B.S. and M.S. from CU Boulder in Applied Mathematics 
        in 2020 and 2022, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of research, I try to get outside as much as possible through climbing, skiing, hiking, rafting, 
        football (the other kind), and a variety of other hobbies.
