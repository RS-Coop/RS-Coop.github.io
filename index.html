    <p>
      I am currently a second year masters student in Applied Mathematics at the
      University of Colorado Boulder. My academic interests lie in computational
      mathematics, including fields such as machine learning, optimization, numerics,
      and more. Outside of academics I am an avid football (the other kind) fan and
      I like to get outside as much as possible.
