      I am currently a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder
      in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC), working with Alireza Doostan
      and Stephen Becker. I recieved my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2019
      and 2022 respectively from CU.

      Broadly, my research interests are in computational and mathematical science.
      I have worked in areas such as non-convex optimization, deep learning, data
      compression, and algorithmic economics. I appreciate both the theory and application
      side of problems, which is to say I enjoy both proving a theorem and programming a
      software package.

      Outside of academics I am an avid football fan (the other kind). I came to
      the game late, so I mostly just appreciate whatching good footy. I also
      like to get outside as much as possible, with climbing and rafting being my
      favourite.
